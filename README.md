# Fashion Blog - Everday with Isa

This project is a simple HTML-based fashion blog website created for "Everyday with Isa". It includes structured HTML elements like headings, images, paragraphs, and links to display blog posts and contact information. The website is designed to give readers an insiderâ€™s guide to NYFW while showcasing related content and providing a way to get in touch with the author.

## Credits
This project is based on an exercise from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-fundamentals">Codecademy</a>. While the initial task description were provided by Codecademy, the HTML file and its structure were fully implemented by me.
